# Introduction

This is a data analysis project that I have done regarding New Jersey gas prices from 1983 to 2022 in every month.
I have obtained my data from https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMA_EPM0_PWG_SNJ_DPG&f=M/
In SQL Server my SQL queries consisted of finding the lowest and highest gas prices in every month throughout every year. I also found the highest and lowest gas prices overall.
